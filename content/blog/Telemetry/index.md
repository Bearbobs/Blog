## Why not Google Analytics

Google Analytics lets us keep tabs on that data, but Google tracks a whole lot more than that, too. Frankly, I don’t want access to that data—or to contribute towards it being collected. Remember, Google’s incentive is to collect as much information as possible from people visiting as many sites as possible—and using Google Analytics directly helps them do that.

If you don’t know, Google happily tracks you across all the websites you visit if those sites use Google Analytics, or if you use Google search. Google then infers and remembers all sorts of information about you; for example your age range, and inferred gender, if you’ve changed jobs or moved recently, and whether you like to spend time outdoors. Google then uses all of this data to target ads to you, in the hopes that more precise ads will get you to bite, thus earning them their commission.

They then offer those profiles up inside of Google Analytics, letting website owners drill down using “In-Market Segments.” The entire mechanism is invasive—and unnecessary for me. And even though I may choose to ignore these profiles and data, by using Google Analytics on my website, I have contributed to creating them. This data collection and surveillance does not align with my values, and I’ve been investigating how I can move away for quite some time now.

According to me there are two option:

* Handcrafting one according to your needs

* Go with an open-source alternative.
